            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>TIs both my duty and my debt, to return the improvement of my talent to you, from whom I first received it, and to pay my thanks for those borrowed sparks which have since kindled and increased into a flame. That debtor is too ungrateful, and deserves to have no favour shew'd him in the principal, that never comes to pay, much less acknowledge an interest. This Obligation, Sir, was one Motive to address this Piece to you, having at first been initiated in this little Art I pretend to, by your Brother and your self; but fearing withal the severe and critical cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of a more judicious Eye. Be pleased there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:199384:4"/> to accept of this small Tribute, not for any worth or desert of its own, but as a Token of my Gratitude. Yuor Name (I confess) is too Great to stand in the Front of so inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a <hi>Paper</hi> as this, wherewith I here present you, and might make a suitable Frontispiece for some for more excellent Work. Whatever it be, it begs your Candid Acceptance; it may parhaps need, but I fear it deserves not so good a Patron. Another reason (Sir) why I offer this Tract to you, is an Ambition I have to bring the World better acquainted with so great a part of its own Treasure, and to make it know that there are yet some such worthy Persons as your Self, whom even they that are Enemies to this present World, cannot refuse both to love and honour. I shall forbear at this time to display your Merits, in reference to my own particular; least he that reads this and sees Your Name praefixed, may expect more by the Epistle than is performed in the Book. And so I make my self Guilty of his Pride and Indiscretion, that sets a fair Porch before a sorry Building. This only Sir, I shall endeavour, and do beg You to believe, that I shall always be industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to manifest my self,</p>

            <p>IT is not any desire either of profit or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, that induc'd me to write this Piece, but only the solicitations of some private Friends, concurring with my own Nature and Inclination, which was always addicted to this Sport, I never could see any thing of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in particular: <hi>The Compleat Angler</hi> hints the most at it, as first of the Nature and Generation, and Age of a <hi>Pike,</hi> quoting the same Author <hi>Gesner</hi> that I do. He also observes some Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Effects of him, the Spawning time, all sorts of Baits; especially of the Frog, he speaks much, and the Ledger Bait. He hath inserted a Story of the Antipathy between a Land Frog, which he conceives venemous, and a Pike in a Pond in <hi>Bohemia.</hi> He shews the way to bait the Hook, as also to play it with Bladders, Bullrushes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Teaches a way to charm and invite the fish, by sweetning the Bait with Gum of Ivy dissolved in Oil of Spike; as likewise a Receipt to roast a Pike. This is the sum of Mr. <hi>Walton</hi>'s Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. Then there is the <hi>Gentleman</hi>'s <hi>Recra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:199384:5"/> hath one Chapter, but much the same as the other, as borrowed from him. I never could see any other concerning <hi>Trolling,</hi> though if there be, it may be of an old standing; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing new does more please, because <hi>Men hominum est noritatis avida.</hi> I have not put it in that florid Dress of Eloquence or Rhetorical Phrases, nor indeed would the Subject bear it.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:199384:5"/> these being only the private Sentiments and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections of my own Experience. The first Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is always the least, if it were worthy of a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Impression, it might receive some Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as having the advantage of being enlarged by the help of some new and more refined Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Nor is the subject Matter enough copious to make a fuller Treatise, it being confin'd to one particular manner of Fishing; which if it had extended to the generality of the Art, and to all the Fresh Water Inhabitants, it might have made this diminutive piece to swell into a Folio.</p>
            <p>The Design of it is only to give th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Whether then it be approved on or not, it must take its fortune as all other Books do, which are blamed by some and commended by others:

            <p>As plain as it is, it may be serviceable to some, and if it had been far better and more accurately
<pb facs="tcp:199384:6"/> done, it might have been condemned by others. Every man that is a Fisherman hath some private thoughts of his own, which he will still prefer before others. Besides the Diversions of Fishing are now generally undervalued, it being an Art which few take pleasure in; nothing passing for noble and delightful, which is not brave and cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; as though men could not gratifie their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses without the consumption of their Estates.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hawking</hi> and <hi>Hunting</hi> have had their Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies celebrated with large Encomiums, and though I design not to slight or disparage those Noble Recreations, which have been so much famed in all Ages and by all degrees, yet this I must affirm, that they fall not within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of every mean person to pursue, being as it were only entailed on vast estates; for if lower Fortunes should seek to enjoy them, <hi>Actaeon</hi>'s Fable might prove a true Story, and these Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous Birds make a prey upon their Masters. Besides those Recreations are more obnoxious to Choller and Passion than these of ours. Our simple Art composes the Soul to that quiet and serenity, which gives a man the fullest possession and fruition of himself and all his enjoyments.</p>
            <p>This clearness and equanimity of Spirit being a matter of so high a concern, is of much value and esteem in the opinion of many profound Philosophers. Witness that Excellent Tract of <hi>Petrarche, De Tranquilitate Animo,</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb facs="tcp:199384:6"/> he that lives, <hi>Sibi &amp; Deo,</hi> leads the most Happy Life. Though all these Contentments and many more, both for Health and Pleasure, as well to gratifie the Senses as delight the Mind, do arise from this cheap, and as some call it, mean Melancholy Art: I say though all these satisfactions do procced from it, and it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds pleasure at such an easie rate, yet I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to meet with no other Entertainment in the publishing of it, then neglect, if not scorn, contempt, and neglect. Some few there are that have cast off their other Recreations and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced this; though I never knew any repent of their learning this, and with-draw their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from their beloved Recreation. If this Art therefore may prove a noble rest to thy mind, it will be a great satisfaction to his, who is thy Well-wishing Friend and Servant,</p>

            <head>ON THE <hi>Antiquity and Invention</hi> OF FISHING, And its Praise in general.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>WHen God at first plac'd <hi>Adam</hi> in a Seat</l>
               <l>So rare, so rich, so princely, and so great,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Edens</hi> fair Garden Eastward to the Sun,</l>
               <l>Thro whose fat soil four silver streams did run.</l>
               <l>The first <hi>Euphrates,</hi> whose fair waves do kiss</l>
               <l>The Monarchs Towers of proud <hi>Semiramis.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Swift <hi>Pison</hi> thence, and <hi>Gihon</hi> did arise, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 2.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Tigris</hi> the Fourth to water <hi>Paradise;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>These in their kind were furnished to present</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> with Fish from th'Watry Element:</l>
               <l>This added to his bliss, by which we see</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Fishing</hi> derives an ancient Pedigree,</l>
               <l>And bears its date from the Forbidden Tree.</l>
               <l>Next unto him that built the Wooden Wall,</l>
               <l>But for whose Ark the Flood had drowned all.</l>
               <l>Yet still the <hi>Fish</hi> mov'd in their proper Sphere,</l>
               <l>They neither Rain, nor Deluge deep did fear.</l>
               <pb facs="tcp:199384:9"/>
               <l>
                  <hi>Noah</hi> with them himself might recreate, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 8.</l>
               <l>Till <hi>Dove</hi> brought news the Waters did abate.</l>
               <l>Food sure was scarce, when Mr. <hi>Flood</hi> had left,</l>
               <l>Few Beasts but those for procreation kept.</l>
               <l>Hunger might force eight persons to devise</l>
               <l>A trick to take what <hi>Fish</hi> to th' top did rise.</l>
               <l>Now this to Poets fiction did afford</l>
               <l>How th' empty World should be with people stor'd.</l>
               <l>When good <hi>Deucalion</hi> and his <hi>Pyrrha</hi> dear,</l>
               <l>Were left of all that overwhelmed were.</l>
               <l>They to an ancient Temple went, that stood</l>
               <l>Forlorn and wasted by the raging Flood.</l>
               <l>Prostrate they fell upon the sacred ground,</l>
               <l>Devoutly praying th' Earth might re-abound.</l>
               <l>The Goddess heard their prayers, &amp; bid them take</l>
               <l>Their Mothers bones, &amp; throw behind their back.</l>
               <l>This Oracle obscure and dark of sense,</l>
               <l>Amaz'd their minds, what they might draw from thence.</l>
               <l>They then view'd hill and dale, each rock &amp; tree,</l>
               <l>And thought the <hi>Earth</hi> their <hi>Mother</hi> well might be.</l>
               <l>Therefore to try if it were false or true,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>The scatter'd stones</hi> behind their <hi>backs</hi> they threw,</l>
               <l>Forthwith the <hi>stones</hi> as they had <hi>life</hi> conceiv'd,</l>
               <l>Began to move, and more and more receiv'd</l>
               <l>The shape of <hi>Man.</hi> Thus was the <hi>World</hi> again</l>
               <l>Supply'd with <hi>people</hi> sprung with little <hi>pain.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But yet no <hi>Birds</hi> or <hi>Beasts</hi> for <hi>meat</hi> was found,</l>
               <l>Since the great <hi>Deluge</hi> all destroy'd and drown'd.</l>
               <l>Then did <hi>Deucalion</hi> first the <hi>Art</hi> invent</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Fishing,</hi> and to <hi>Woods</hi> and <hi>Groves</hi> he went:</l>
               <pb facs="tcp:199384:9"/>
               <l>There from the <hi>Trees long rinds &amp; crooks he brake,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And made them <hi>hooks</hi> and <hi>lines</hi> the <hi>Fish</hi> to take.</l>
               <l>In this rude sort began this simple <hi>Art,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>The <hi>Fish</hi> as yet had felt but little smart.</l>
               <l>And were to bite more eager, apt, and bold,</l>
               <l>In that first Age, which was then all of Gold.</l>
               <l>But when in time the fear and dread of <hi>Man</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Fell more and more on th' <hi>Creatures,</hi> they began</l>
               <l>To stand in awe of this Usurping <hi>King,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>That did both <hi>Seas</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> in thraldom bring.</l>
               <l>'Twas then a <hi>Work</hi> of greater skill to take</l>
               <l>The wary <hi>Fish</hi> in any <hi>Pond</hi> or <hi>Lake.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>So worse and worse two <hi>Ages</hi> more did pass,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Hooks</hi> were made of <hi>Silver</hi> and of <hi>Brass;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And <hi>Lines</hi> of <hi>Hemp</hi> and <hi>Flax</hi> were framed new,</l>
               <l>So still this <hi>Art</hi> more perfect daily grew.</l>
               <l>But at the last the <hi>Iron Age</hi> grew near,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Hooks</hi> of hardest <hi>Steel</hi> invented were:</l>
               <l>And <hi>Rods</hi> of lightest <hi>Cane</hi> and <hi>Hazel Plant,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And <hi>Lines</hi> of <hi>Silk</hi> and <hi>Hair</hi> no <hi>Skill</hi> did want.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus far the <hi>Fable.</hi> â€”next the <hi>Truth</hi> presents</l>
               <l>How <hi>Fish</hi> of <hi>wonders</hi> have been <hi>instruments.</hi>

One of 40 inches (I said) might haply be of so many years standing; not that a <hi>Pike</hi> grow just about an Inch in a year, for that is a thing that is hard to determine, some grow faster, some slower, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diversity of their Water and their Feed: River Fish are thought to grow much fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than Pond Fish; except the Pond be very large and have a good stream run through it: for there is nothing helps so much to the feeding of a <hi>Pike</hi> as fresh Water. That's the reason why a <hi>Pike</hi> will not bite well after a great Rain. <hi>Jacks</hi> or <hi>Pickerills</hi> grow faster than great ones, and I have observed in a cleer and springing Brook, that a <hi>Jack</hi> spawn'd in <hi>March</hi> will take a Bait in <hi>October</hi> following, and will be encreased to Eighteen Inches the next <hi>March.</hi> In standing Water, as Motes and Ponds, he grows nothing so fast; for to try the experiment, I have taken one out with a Cast-net in <hi>May,</hi> Measured him and Mark'd him on his Tail, and about <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> I have taken the same fish, as appear'd by the Mark, and then measured him again and he hath not encreased in length above two Inches, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:199384:16"/> very little in Breadth. A River Fish will grow very fast till he come to be 24 or near 30 Inches, then he stands a little more at astay, and spreads himself in thickness; after that he will grow a long time, and be much longer growing to his full bigness from 30 Inches, than he was encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to that proportion. He is a great Breeder and Multiplier, as we may see in those places that are preserv'd, how soon a River is full stock'd. Small <hi>Jacks</hi> shew themselves much after a Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flood, every Ditch is then full of <hi>Pickerills,</hi> and the Fenns are so abundantly stor'd with them, that you may buy an Horse load for a shilling. Its the Spring Tide that brings them up most, for about <hi>Midsummer</hi> and after they much decrease <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>nd diminish in their number; some being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with Snares and Bow-nets, some with Trol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and many little ones devoured by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: So that in the Stocking of a Pond, the wisest course is to put in all your <hi>Jacks</hi> as near as you can of a bigness, for a <hi>Pike</hi> of 30 Inches will make no bones of one of 16. As to the encrease of them, some are apt to grow more in length, others more in Breath and Thickness; which latter sort are the best fed and the firmest Fishes; for a lean, slender <hi>Pike,</hi> though he may seem to advance and improve in length, yet he is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Waster; for if he hath received any outward hurt, or wound, either by the <hi>Otter</hi> or by a strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his own species, or is inwardly pricked by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:199384:16"/> the Hook or any casualty, yet still he will live and eat his Meat, and be as hungry as <hi>Pharao</hi>'s lean Kine, which devoured the fat ones: he will be yet for Plunder and greedy as ever, tho he neither thrive nor grow; this I observed in a large <hi>Pike</hi> which I took in a wasting conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he had a long Hook in his Belly, and the end of the Wire hung out of his Mouth; he might probably have been long in that declining estate, and so might have continued a considerable time, though he fall away, and must at last ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily die of a Consumption. There are several circumstances of time and place which may be very advantageous and conduce much to the growth of a <hi>Pike,</hi> a still shady unfrequented place, where he is not affrighted and disturbed at his Feed is very Commodious for his rest and repast; especially if his Shelter be thick and convenient for him: for if a Ditch joyn upon the River, or a Spring or small Brook run into it, his abode will be more pleasing and delightsome; if it be a solitary and retired corner, not beaten with Fishers and the often visits of his flatering Friends.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Seat and Harbour of a <hi>Pike.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Place and Harbour of a <hi>Pike</hi> is usually amongst or near a Bank of Weeds; for he does not always confine himself to his bed and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:199384:17"/> lye close like a <hi>Fox</hi> in his den, but often shoots out and sports in the cleer stream; and (like the great <hi>Leviathan</hi>) takes his pastime in the middle of the Waters. The Weeds indeed are his chiefest refuge and his Sanctuary, if he be affrighted by a Net or the sudden disturbance of his approaching Enemy; he then strikes into his accustomed Harbour, and there keeps his Garison. Those weeds where he most delights to make his Residence, are Flags and Bulrushes; if there be none of those, then <hi>Candocks</hi> have the next honour to entertain this princely Guest. There are other Weeds where he thinks fit to make his abode, as Reeds, green Fog, and a Weed with a small leaf, which he often frequents, especially about <hi>October,</hi> when they begin to rot. If a place be very thick and weedy, you cannot so easily guess where his Lodgings are, but if the River be free from weeds, only here and there a bank or bed of Bullrushes, you may safely conclude those are his retirements and his baiting places: If your River be very broad, deep, and streight like a Scoure, it will be so much the more difficult to find his recess; and if there be but few fish, it will be next to seeking a Needle in a Bottle of Hay; for in such a kind of false River you may Troll perhaps from Morning till Night and scarce get a bite. But if such a place be little beaten, and have plenty of <hi>Fish</hi> you may have sport enough to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:199384:17"/> encourage you to the same place; but then you must arm your self with a great deal of patience, and fish it very true and slow. There's not so much variety and delight in <hi>Trolling</hi> such a River, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is all along even and alike, and you cannot conceive where your prey lies; this you may call Hap-hazard, and expect a bite every throw, though you go three or four hours, and neither see nor feel any Fish but your own Bait. Some there are that place their sport in Hopes, and take as much delight in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation as others doe in frution; but a little En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement does well; not only for the profits sake (as something has some savour) but also to save the credit and keep away despair from the Melancholy <hi>Fisherman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The best and securest way of Fishing these wide Reaches, is by drawing the bait along the sides next to you, except you can search the breadth of it, and throw over to the farther side; but that is but dull and slow Sport, and it will spend a great deal of time to <hi>Troll</hi> the length of a Furlong. If your River consists of pits, which is the quickest and most delightsome way of <hi>Trolling,</hi> you must have a special regard to the top and bottom of the Pit. A <hi>Pike</hi> may be taken sometimes in the middle, but his chiefest Seat and Habitation is at the bottom of the Pit; and this I have often observed, that where one <hi>Pike</hi> hath been taken at the Mouth, another
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:199384:18"/> hath been found at the feet or bottom of the Pit.</p>
               <p>These are the ordinary places; yet according to the variety of Weather and Seasons of the Year, a <hi>Pike</hi> will alter and change his dwelling. In the Winter he usually couches very nigh the ground, and gets into the deepest and obscurest places; about the latter end of <hi>February,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> he begins to be weary of his melancholly repose, and to raise himself a little from the bottom, and is more active in seeking his feed: At the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> or sometimes the middle, he shoots into the scoures, and there leaves the Spawn to multiply accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its kind. In <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> he still gets higher, and advances himself into the shallows; and if he may lie unmolested there, he will so continue most part of Summer; in <hi>September</hi> he begins to retreat again, and removes himself from his accustomed harbour to visit his Winter Quarters, which will be much the same as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if no floods disorder him: This is his yearly course to change according to heat or cold, so that a <hi>Pike,</hi> like a Person of Quality, hath both a Winter and a Summer House. As to his dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Transactions, he thus disposes of himself: In a hot gleamy day, he gets to the Surface of the Water, as if he had a desire to exchange his Element, to enjoy the comfortable influence of the Airy Region, he then scorns to be tempted
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:199384:18"/> with a Bait, and can live all day with a little more nourishment than the Motes in the Sun: for you can no sooner offer him the kindness of a deceitful Bit, but he's gone as swift as light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to abscond himself in his lowest retirements. There are some that will make such brags of their Art, that they have the confidence to say, They can find a <hi>Pike</hi> as easily in his seat, as an old <hi>Hare-finder</hi> can take Puss in her Furm; and that the same <hi>Pike</hi> will as infallibly take your Bait, as an hungry Dog will leap at a Crust: They would make you believe they are good <hi>Accomptants,</hi> and such <hi>Water Arithmeticians,</hi> that they can tell the number of the <hi>Fish</hi> in the River as well as <hi>Graziers</hi> can count their Sheep and Beasts in their Pastures. These Stories are too Romantick to gain the credit of sober <hi>Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> though one that hath had much experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and made it his business, may give a near guess where the <hi>Fish</hi> lies: some places are more probable than others, though you will often meet with them in the middle as well as by the sides, and sometimes unexpectedly where there is no conveniency of shelter or repast. A Ford that is cleer and gravelly at the bottom, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if it have a Spit adjoyning to it that is indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent deep and weedy, is looked upon as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable place: for though they generally affect a deep Water, yet they will get as near as they can to a Ford or Shallow; where they delight

One about Two Foot or Twenty six Inches, is most grateful to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> and a <hi>Male Fish</hi> of that size is generally fat and delicious. <hi>Physicians</hi> affirm that the <hi>Chyle</hi> or <hi>Juice</hi> of such a <hi>Fish</hi> concocted, is more wholesome to the <hi>Stomach,</hi> than one of the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>proportion;</hi> though all <hi>Fish</hi> are naturally light and of easy digestion.

                  </hi> is in so much fear of him, and hath that Antipathy against him, that he will much sooner fasten upon one of his own kind, then upon him; yet I have seen small <hi>Perches</hi> taken out of a <hi>Pikes</hi> belly, but it was in a <hi>Mote</hi> where he was kept short and had little else to feed upon; but if you be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to this Bait, and can get no other to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote your sport, it is best to scrape off some of the <hi>Scales,</hi> for it being a dark Fish, it will make it look somwhat brighter, and still the <hi>Snap</hi> is the best <hi>Hook</hi> for it, because if the <hi>Scales</hi> of the <hi>Perch</hi> be on, a <hi>Pike</hi> cannot easily gorge or digest it. A small <hi>Jack</hi> is a far better <hi>Bait,</hi> though it seems unnatural, yet Fish are not bound to observe the Laws of Nature. If it be a foot long, it may be cut in two, and so made use of. A young <hi>Chub</hi> or a <hi>Shallow</hi> may be very useful, or any <hi>Fish</hi> that glisters and shines in the Water; a <hi>Bleak</hi> is a very bright
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:199384:29"/> Fish. The way to keep and preserve your <hi>Baits</hi> till you have occasion to use them, is first to take a <hi>Cast Net</hi> and throw it, choosing those that are most fit for the purpose; and so lay them up in store: which must be done by having a Trunk ready to put them in, and then to take them out by two or three as occasion serves. In <hi>Summer</hi> time you may take them with an <hi>Angle,</hi> but that is very uncertain; nor can you have any choice that way, because they will often be too little or too big, besides it spends too much of the day that is intended for <hi>Trolling:</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times you may take with one <hi>Bait</hi> fresh out of the <hi>Trunk,</hi> three or four <hi>Jacks</hi> or more; for a <hi>Fish</hi> that <hi>bites</hi> greedily and swallows the <hi>Bait,</hi> presently does not tear it so much, as one that plays with it in his mouth and then leaves it; for a <hi>Bait</hi> is not much worse for being chopt and full of holes, provided it hang well upon the <hi>Hook,</hi> and the <hi>lead</hi> is not seen; for one <hi>Pike</hi> will feed very well after another, and the <hi>Bait</hi> will be still the sweeter the more it is bitten, if it be not used so long to be water-sopt: the <hi>Scales</hi> of a <hi>Roch</hi> or <hi>Dace</hi> are a great preservation to it, as also light and perspicuous, which render it more visible to the eyes of the great devourer: As to the definite number of <hi>Baits,</hi> it cannot be positively determined; two or three if fresh, will last long enough, if you have not very ill luck with them; for sometimes the first <hi>Fish</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:199384:29"/> that <hi>bites</hi> will tear the <hi>Bait:</hi> so that it will make it unserviceable, and yet not take the <hi>Pike,</hi> but the <hi>Weeds</hi> are most destructive to your <hi>Baits,</hi> especially when they are strong and tuff; so that if you be not careful in tying the tail of the <hi>Bait</hi> fast to the joynt of the <hi>Wire,</hi> the <hi>Weed</hi> will consume it, before the <hi>Pike</hi> comes. Some <hi>Fish</hi> will hold better than others; a <hi>Dace</hi> is one of the hardest, and will endure the longest; but a <hi>Gudgeon</hi> is but a tender <hi>Fish,</hi> and will soon burst: one fresh <hi>Bait</hi> will wear out two or three stale ones: Besides these natural <hi>Baits,</hi> there are a sort of Artificial ones, which are made so exquisitely to resemble the other, that they will delude the eyes of some Men, much more of the <hi>Fish;</hi> for if they be only look'd on, and not felt or touch'd with the finger, there is no doubt to be made of the reality of the <hi>Fish.</hi> Some pretend to <hi>Fish</hi> at <hi>Pouch</hi> with these Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial deceits, though 'tis more probable they were designed for the <hi>Snap;</hi> for a <hi>Pike</hi> is endued with a perfect sense of tasting, and therefore will scarce be courted to gorge and digest that which he can neither taste nor smell: There are indeed some of those Artificial <hi>Baits</hi> made after the <hi>Pouch</hi> fashion, whether for sight or service, to look upon rather then to use, I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; for I more admired the curiosity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity of the Artificer, then any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary excellency or usefulness in the thing. A

                  <hi>Pike</hi> must be very hungry that gorges one of them, and he must do it hastily and greedily, for if he stays to consider of it and plays much with it, as some of them do, his curious and delicate <hi>Palate</hi> will presently distinguish a fresh and well relishing Morsel, from a dry and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipid bit.</p>
               <p>Those that are covetous, may have two strings to their bow; by taking a <hi>Gudgeon</hi> of a middle size or a large <hi>Minow,</hi> for then they may be in hopes of taking large <hi>Perches</hi> as well as <hi>Pikes,</hi> for a <hi>Minnow</hi> is an excellent <hi>Bait</hi> for a <hi>Perch;</hi> great <hi>Baits</hi> do most invite a <hi>Pike,</hi> but little ones are more secure to take him.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Of the</hi> Pouch-Hook.</head>
               <p>OF <hi>Pike-Hooks</hi> or <hi>Jack-Hooks,</hi> there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral sorts, both for the <hi>Snap</hi> and <hi>Pouch,</hi> the latter of which, we shall only endeavour to describe in this place; for though the <hi>Spring-Hooks</hi> are esteemed excellent, and strike sure, yet the ordinary plain <hi>Snap-Hook</hi> will miss al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as often as it hits. Of <hi>Pouch-Hooks</hi> there are many fashions, some with a round bent, almost after the figure of a <hi>Perch-Hook;</hi> that may be very good, though I never made use of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:199384:30"/> that fashion; for there is another sort which have a sloping bent outward, turning a little inwards under the beard, and withal bending the lead at the point of it, which point must be as sharp at it can be made; much after this fashion<figure>
                     <figDesc>woodcut of pouch hook</figDesc>
                  </figure>
               </p>
               <p>It is the best to choose them of a black and somewhat blewish colour, indifferent thick and strong, the lead not very gross, but neatly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, without any flaws or hollows in it, you may lead it your self if you buy them bare; by putting your <hi>Hook</hi> into a <hi>Reed,</hi> or a piece of <hi>Elder,</hi> or any such hollow thing; provided you do it fair and smooth, making it thicker in the middle or towards the bottom, then at the top, which must be narrow and slender. It will require an indifferent quantity of lead, for if it be pretty weighty, it plays the <hi>Bait</hi> the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; this is supposed of a single <hi>Hook,</hi> though the double one is the same as to the lead and joynts of the wire: I commonly made use of the single <hi>Hook,</hi> which strikes as sure as the other. The double <hi>Hook</hi> hath one advantage above the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:199384:31"/> other, that if it meets with such resistance in the <hi>Water,</hi> that it loses one side of it, the other part with a little plaining and filing, may be still as serviceable as it was before; it is more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome in the <hi>Water,</hi> and more apt to check and take hold of the <hi>Weeds</hi> and <hi>Roots;</hi> it is the fittest for a great <hi>Bait,</hi> for if you put a small and slender <hi>Bait</hi> on a double <hi>Hook,</hi> it will hang out and bear off so much in the bendings, that a <hi>Pike</hi> may not only discover the delusion and craft of it, but if he chance to take it, it may check him in his feeding, and so hinder him from gorging of it: There are two or three sorts of double <hi>Hooks,</hi> besides that of the <hi>Snap,</hi> some of them are flat and are bent back to back, after this manner:<figure>
                     <figDesc>woodcut of double hook</figDesc>
                  </figure> Another sort there is that is more sloped and the bents closer together; others there are that have a round bent, much after the form of the <hi>Snap,</hi> which must always have a full bent, and very large; That is baited by fixing the <hi>Hook</hi> in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:199384:31"/> the middle of the <hi>Bait,</hi> and may have the lead fastened to the <hi>Wire;</hi> the way to use that, is to strike soon after the <hi>Fish</hi> bite, and as the <hi>Pike</hi> runs one way to strike the contrary.</p>
               <p>In the choice of <hi>Hooks,</hi> you may have some regard to the <hi>Wire,</hi> lest that be rugged or knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for if that be not found and strong, you may lose both your <hi>Fish</hi> and your <hi>Hook.</hi> The first joynt of it which is next the <hi>Lead,</hi> must be so long that the tail of the <hi>Bait</hi> may not reach over it, for if it does, you cannot well fasten it to the joynt, though in a time of necessity you may untwist the wire of the upper joynt, and there fix the thred; some <hi>Baits</hi> are short, as <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> and <hi>Shallows;</hi> some are longer, as <hi>Daces, Bleaks,</hi> or large <hi>Gudgeons,</hi> which require that the <hi>Hook</hi> and <hi>Wire</hi> be both long proportionable to it. The other joynt which is fastened to the <hi>Line,</hi> must be twice or thrice the length of the other; lest when the <hi>Pike</hi> hath gorged the <hi>Bait</hi> deep into his <hi>Ventricle,</hi> the <hi>Wire</hi> be not long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to reach out of his mouth, and so he shear and cut the <hi>Line</hi> with his <hi>Teeth;</hi> this joynt had need be very fine and smooth, lest if it be rugged, it tear the <hi>Bait</hi> when you put it on; if this be stiff and strong, you need not that which they call the <hi>Arming Wire</hi> to help you thrust it out of the tail of the <hi>Bait;</hi> you may sometimes search your <hi>Wire,</hi> least it be faulty or broken, especially the lowest joynt, for
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:199384:32"/> there it often breaks, and may deceive you in your intended pastime.</p>
               <p>There are another sort of <hi>Hooks</hi> which are made purposely for the <hi>Ledger Baits;</hi> those are used with live <hi>Fish,</hi> and are not leaded, the <hi>Hook</hi> is rather shorter than the other, but the <hi>Wire</hi> hath usually more joynts. The <hi>Lines</hi> for these need not be so long as the <hi>Trolling Line,</hi> for they may be thrown into the <hi>Water,</hi> and so gaged with a stick; for a <hi>Pike</hi> will not so soon take a <hi>Bait</hi> off the ground, as if it swims a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a foot or more from the bottom. The way of <hi>Fishing</hi> with <hi>Ledger-Baits</hi> is too destructive to be made a common practice, and far below the diversions of a fair <hi>Fisherman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The best <hi>Hooks</hi> may be chosen by their <hi>Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> which is the hardest and best temper'd <hi>Steel;</hi> these are so well composed, that they break and snap, rather then stand bent, or be the least moved from their first frame and figure; there is much variety in <hi>Hooks,</hi> and a great deal of deceit in them, and therefore it requires skill and caution to choose the best.</p>
               <p>When you fasten the <hi>Wire</hi> to the <hi>Line,</hi> you must be sure to tie it with a right knot; least it catch a <hi>Weed</hi> that is far stronger then a <hi>Pike,</hi> and it slip the knot and get from you; but if all your <hi>Tackling</hi> be new and sound, you need not fear to adventure among <hi>Fog</hi> or <hi>Weeds,</hi> or any thing but <hi>Roots</hi> and <hi>Stumps</hi> of <hi>Trees,</hi> which may
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:199384:32"/> hold play with a <hi>Cart-Rope.</hi> To this end the safest and most secure way of fastening, is first to tie one single knot, and then one that will slip, or else only the slipping not, allowing it an inch or two of <hi>Line,</hi> and then girding and drawing it close, first making tryal of it with all your strength before you put it into the <hi>Water</hi> it's a neat and handsome way to fasten it with a <hi>Swivel,</hi> tying it close with a bit of Thred; this seems to play the Bait better, giving it a turn when you stir it, which makes it glister and swim like a live <hi>Fish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are a sort of course <hi>Hooks</hi> made of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> and thick <hi>Wire,</hi> which may make a shift to serve those that can get no better.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>Of the</hi> Trolling Line.</head>
               <p>NOw as to the Line it self, it is one of the chiefest and most necessary <hi>Member</hi> that is required to the Constitution of the body of a <hi>Fisherman:</hi> for an ordinary and indifferent <hi>Hook</hi> may be sometimes dispenc'd withal to shew good sport, as also the <hi>Pole;</hi> but if your <hi>Line</hi> be not strong and of a considerable length, you can have but little hopes of any competent
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:199384:33"/> success: The best materials for the composure of your <hi>Line,</hi> is green or blew <hi>Silk,</hi> which <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulcan</hi> colour is most resembling and agreeable to the <hi>Water;</hi> but it is possible it may be only a fancy that that colour is of more consequence than another; yet sometimes the pleasing of the fancy, does so much enliven and encourage the <hi>Fisherman,</hi> that it makes him the more active and laborious, and so by that means is the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of all his sport; and if his fancy divert him another way, he will take the less care and pains in his present pastime.</p>
               <p>Next to <hi>Silk,</hi> the best sort of green <hi>Thred</hi> is to be preferred, which though it be neither so handsome or so durable as <hi>Silk,</hi> yet it may last very strongly a year or two: but that wears like other things, according to the care and good keeping of the user; for if it be laid up wet, and on an heap, as soon as you have done <hi>Fishing,</hi> and take no more care of it, you may haply rot out as many <hi>Lines</hi> as you catch <hi>Pikes:</hi> The best way then of preserving it, is to wax it sometimes with <hi>Bees-wax,</hi> and when it is wet to wind it up loosly in long foldings, that the Air may come in to dry it, or else let it dry at length, and then wind it upon a Roll: with such usage, a <hi>Silk Line</hi> will last beyond your expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>There are some that make their <hi>Lines</hi> of <hi>Sheep</hi> or <hi>Cats</hi> Guts; but I cannot conceive they
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:199384:33"/> are so suitable and agreeable to the <hi>Water</hi> as <hi>Silk,</hi> or <hi>Thred; Silk</hi> and <hi>Hair</hi> may be fitly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in the making of a <hi>Line;</hi> some make them of <hi>Silk</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> thinking that way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it; tho the addition of <hi>Silver</hi> may be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to please their fancy and the gaity of their humour, then to keep their <hi>Line</hi> from perishing; such as they should have <hi>Silver Hooks</hi> to their <hi>Silver Lines,</hi> that if it cannot take <hi>Fish</hi> it self in the Water, it may take them ready caught, and so be useful in saving their credit.</p>
               <p>There are other sorts of course <hi>Lines</hi> very short, not above half the length of the <hi>Trolling Line,</hi> which are either to Fish with a <hi>Ledger-Bait,</hi> or to lie all night, being tyed to a Float, and cast into the water.</p>
               <p>These are not made of such fine stuff, neither are so well twisted as the other, and only serves in some exigencies, as when a <hi>Pike</hi> that will not be invited by <hi>Trolling,</hi> may be better pleased with a <hi>Bait</hi> that is laid for him: he will some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times so humble himself as to take it off the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; but it is the wiser course to tie a stick or a cork to the <hi>Line,</hi> that it may hang about a foot or more from the ground, observing the Wind withal, for if you throw it in against the Wind, it will drive it backwards, and carry the <hi>Bait</hi> close to the side, and though a <hi>Pike</hi> often har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours by the side, yet the middle hath more scope and advantage of drawing him to it; for
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:199384:34"/> these laying <hi>Lines</hi> the worst sort will serve, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the lying so long in the Water is the ready way to rot them.</p>
               <p>As to the length of the <hi>Line,</hi> it is good to have enough, and far better to leave than to lack; for though a short <hi>Line</hi> may do very well in a <hi>Brook</hi> or some narrow place, where the <hi>Pike</hi> must either run upwards or downwards, and so you may follow your sport, yet if you come to a broad Reach, where the <hi>Fish</hi> run cross the <hi>Stream</hi> to the far side, you may often miss of your <hi>Pike</hi> for want of a few yards of <hi>Line;</hi> for if he be the least curb'd or stopt in his so speedy Career, and may not have his full swing, he is presently check'd, and leaves his suspicious prey. This I have often found by experience, though my <hi>Line</hi> was long enough, yet having a knot in it that would not quickly pass, as also being so entangled that it much shortened it, I have by that means lost very good <hi>Fish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the precise length of it, that need not be determined, about 30 yards is a good <hi>medium</hi> for the <hi>Pouch,</hi> I cannot see any reason why it need be so long at <hi>Snap,</hi> for though they may throw out as far at <hi>Snap,</hi> yet that strikes as soon as he <hi>bites,</hi> and lets him run no farther, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as at <hi>Pouch</hi> he may go farther with it still, though it be far cast.</p>
               <p>It's true that for the <hi>Line</hi> at <hi>Snap</hi> ought to be thicker and stronger, for a sudden jerk may
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:199384:34"/> break that which might hold a good pull by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; but as to the length, it need not be so long, because that is only for casting in, and a <hi>Pike</hi> will sometimes run farther with it then it can be thrown: so that I have seen those that have fish'd at <hi>Snap,</hi> with no longer a <hi>Line</hi> then what was tyed to the <hi>Pole,</hi> and so cast it up and down like an <hi>Angle:</hi> this was too short to be confin'd to no more <hi>Line</hi> then what was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the <hi>Pole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the managing of the <hi>Line</hi> and fitting it for your sport, you may wind it upon a <hi>Roll</hi> that turns upon a ring of <hi>Iron</hi> with your finger in it, having no more in your hand then you make use of at the present: so that if occasion be, you may unwind it at your lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p>Some draw it after them at length, which I approve as a very good way; if there be no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments in the way; as <hi>Shrubs</hi> or <hi>Bushes</hi> to interrupt or make them go back; it will be very ready to cast out, and may throw it the farthest; for if you hold a great deal loose in your hand, it will be apt to knot and tangle, which will try the <hi>Fishermans</hi> patience. Some object that the drawing the <hi>Line</hi> upon the ground will be apt to wear it out sooner, but that is questionable, for it sooner dries so, and when it is dry, it can take but little harm: besides a <hi>Pike</hi> will sometimes be so hasty and furious, that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:199384:35"/> he will scarce give you leave to unwind fast e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for him, and therefore the surest way to trapan him, is to make preparation for him, by having your <hi>Line</hi> at command in a compleat readiness.</p>

               <p>SUpposing your <hi>Hook</hi> be good, and your <hi>Line</hi> strong, you may make the better shift with an indifferent <hi>Pole;</hi> though some that are more curious in their <hi>Tackling</hi> than painful and patient in their <hi>Fishing,</hi> will not stir a foot without all the formalities of an exquisite <hi>Fisherman:</hi> such precise Crafts-Masters as these, can spend their time in admiring their <hi>Instruments,</hi> and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently delight themselves with the commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their own <hi>Materials.</hi> This is certain and undeniable, that the longer the <hi>Pole</hi> is, if it be streight and light, you will find the more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in playing the <hi>Bait</hi> and throwing it from you; for if there be <hi>Flags</hi> or <hi>Reed</hi> between the <hi>Bank</hi> and the main <hi>deep,</hi> you can very hardly play your <hi>Bait</hi> with a short <hi>Pole.</hi> I confess I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten put a <hi>Ring</hi> upon my <hi>Hand-stick</hi> and made use of that instead of a <hi>Rod,</hi> and have had the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:199384:35"/> fortune sometimes to take a <hi>Pike</hi> well nigh as long as my <hi>Pole:</hi> sometimes I have taken nothing with me, but confided in the <hi>Willows</hi> that grew next to the place designed for that days Recreation, cutting down as good a Stick as I could find, and so making a bent at the end for the <hi>Line</hi> to slip; and have left it at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of the Sport: In a broad River or a Pond, being at a pinch, I have had no <hi>Pole</hi> at all, but only took the <hi>Bait</hi> in my hand, and cast it from me like a stone to the length of my <hi>Line,</hi> the end of which I was sure to fasten about me, least I threw it quite out, and then have repented of my folly when it was too late to amend it. In some places they fish altogether that way where the <hi>River</hi> is deep and clear from <hi>Weeds.</hi> I never accustomed my self to a long <hi>Pole,</hi> lest I might seem like them that make a great bustle, and take but few <hi>Fish.</hi> I generally made use of an <hi>Alder</hi> as long as I could get, commonly about three yards long, which I bark'd and kept dry for lightness and easie carriage; when it was throughly dry it would be tough, and so light, that I could scarce feel it in my hand; and there is no objection to be made, that such a stick is too weak; for any thing is strong enough at <hi>Pouch</hi> that will play the <hi>Bait</hi> and throw it from you; there is no weight or stress upon the <hi>Pole,</hi> and but little upon the <hi>Line;</hi> if you strike the <hi>Fish</hi> gently and play him slightly and dexterou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:199384:36"/> you may tire him with a slender <hi>Line,</hi> if it be long and can keep him from <hi>Weeds</hi> and <hi>Roots;</hi> at <hi>Snap</hi> indeed your <hi>Tackling</hi> must be all fitted accordingly, your <hi>Line</hi> very strong, and your <hi>Pole</hi> on purpose of a good <hi>Ash,</hi> or <hi>Withy,</hi> or <hi>Hazel</hi> well dryed; streight and tuff, that it may be able to draw him out <hi>nolens volens,</hi> by meer force and compulsion: He that uses that way is scarce a word and a blow, for the mistaken <hi>Fish</hi> no sooner lays his Mouth upon the deceitful <hi>Bait,</hi> but he is catch'd up into another Element. The way of <hi>Pouch</hi> is far more mild and flattering, though as much destructive and pernicious. If you use an <hi>Ash</hi> or an <hi>Hazel Pole,</hi> you must have a <hi>Ring</hi> fixed at the end, some have two; that is one in the middle, though I see no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of that superfluity. If it be an <hi>Alder</hi> or a <hi>Cane,</hi> or any hollow Wood, you may have an <hi>Iron Ring</hi> made to screw in at the top about an handful or more in length, or else that which may be at well, a piece of dry <hi>Alder</hi> that is cut sharp and sloping about three or four Inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es long, which you may stick fast in the end of the <hi>Pole;</hi> some have only a Ring with a little Screw very short. If your <hi>Pole</hi> be of <hi>Alder,</hi> it will be apt to crack, you may secure that by binding the end of it hard with a Waxed Thred, and then you may thrust in at the top without any danger of breaking or cleaving the <hi>Pole.</hi> A dry <hi>Withy</hi> or <hi>Hazel,</hi> bored about twelve or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:199384:36"/> Foot, will make an excellent <hi>Pole;</hi> which may serve for <hi>Angling</hi> if it be so long, only put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a top into it, as also at <hi>Snap.</hi> It is a great ease to have a light <hi>Pole,</hi> and therefore the best course is to get them in the season of the year, and let them stand near the Fire, or in some dry place, for the space of half a year or more; for if your Rod be green and heavy, it will make you weary of your Sport, and be a great hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and discouragement to your <hi>Fishing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth is, if sport be quick and good, scarce any thing can vex or discompose the <hi>Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi> for he is then so attentive on his pleasure, that he takes little notice of those inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which otherwise might be a trouble and vexation to him; he then regards neither Wind nor Weather, and disdains those slight pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations of Cold, Thirst, or Hunger; he hath then gotten the <hi>Philosophers</hi> Stone which sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens all his other crosses, and turns all disasters into Gold. His Sport is a Cordial for all his Distempers, and the <hi>Pike</hi> (like a good <hi>Water-Physician</hi>) can cure him of all his Diseases: if he be weary, his sport refreshes him, if cold, it warms him; if melancholly, it cheers him; if drowsie, it revives him; if in pain, it eases him; if sick, it recovers him: he then fee's not the weight of his <hi>Pole,</hi> nor is concern'd that his <hi>Tackling</hi> is no better. This is the prosperity of the <hi>Fisher,</hi> but if you see him in adversity,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:199384:37"/> when fortune does not smile on his endeavours, you shall, find him much altered, and in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary condition; supposing (I say) the thing called <hi>Luck</hi> does not attend him, and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Sport does not sweeten all other Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, which should refine all the dross of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward misfortunes, he it then so much at a loss and dejected, that he can expect but a bitter potion: Patience and Hopes are the tw<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:199384:38"/> so separate the <hi>Hook</hi> from the <hi>Bait;</hi> some fasten it with a Needle.</p>
               <p>The best way of fixing your <hi>Hook</hi> to the <hi>Line,</hi> is with a <hi>Swivel,</hi> which if you have not, you may make it fast with one slipping knot, which you may untie without cutting your <hi>Line.</hi>

               <p>When you are thus fixed for your intended Sport, then drop in your <hi>Bait</hi> first even before you, then cast it on each side to search them, and let the third throw be before you into the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, afterwards cast about all places where you conceive your Game lies, or any where that you can fish without annoyance; for a <hi>Pike</hi> often delights himself in a very unlikely and improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Harbour; and therefore the surest way to meet with him, is to fish true and close; mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing as little of the River as you can: which though it be tedious, yet it is the only way to search and see what store of <hi>Fish</hi> a <hi>River</hi> afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and you may often have a <hi>Bite,</hi> when you think least of it.</p>

When you have raised your <hi>Bait</hi> so high towards the top, it may be within two or three foot, that you can perceive it to glister; you may then comfort your self with the hopes of a <hi>Pike</hi> that may rise at it, as he often does, and therefore it is not prudence to bee too hasty in taking out the <hi>Bite.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> How to strike a <hi>Pike</hi> and land him.</head>
               <p>WHen you have diverted your self as long as you think good with the pleasure of a <hi>Bite,</hi> and can guess by the running of the <hi>Pike,</hi> what progress he hath made in his repaste, by his ranging about for more; you may then hook him with a small jerk, and so take your fill of your contented sport: for though vve say of a <hi>Pike</hi> as of a Thief, give him Rope enough and he will hang himself, yet a fine gentle stroak will do no harm, but rather secure him, and entangle him the faster: supposing then that he
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:199384:41"/> hath fed a little, you may observe what moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he makes. If he takes the <hi>Bait</hi> greedily at bottom, and marches up the Stream with it, or strikes cross the <hi>River</hi> towards his hold, he will then probably lie still a little time, while he is <hi>Pouching,</hi> as you may feel him check and tug at it; from which place if he goes quick, you may let him alone a little longer, for you may come to lose all for want of two or three minutes forbearance: if he hath lain still a while the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time and then runs with it, you may let him go with it still, if you have a desire to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Sport; if not, you may draw your <hi>Line</hi> streight, and with your <hi>Pole</hi> give him an easie stroke, and so feel him by degrees, till you come to see him; but if he makes much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance and is very furious, let him have <hi>Line</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and give him his full swing: he will be very angry at first, till he is better pacified by losing of his strength.</p>
               <p>As soon as you strike him, you may conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of what bigness he is, for if he be large you will find him strong and unruly in the Water; but if small and light, you can scarce tell whether you have any thing or not, or perhaps he may (for madness) leap out of the Water as soon as he is prick'd; but if he be a good one, at (I say) you may either see or feel him: you must be very cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and take a great deal of care and diligence
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:199384:42"/> in getting him to shore; for if the River be broad and your <hi>Line</hi> short, you may very well lose him; for he will launch out with that extremity and violence, that though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not break the <hi>Line,</hi> yet he vvill tear his ovvn Entrails, if he be there hung.</p>
               <p>Novv if a <hi>Fish</hi> takes your Bait at the top of the Water, and runs fiercely with it into the deep, and there lies still for some time, and you perceive that he does not <hi>Pouch</hi> it, your remedy for that is to stir him a little, to make him run and be more eager of it; then after he hath lain still and runs vvith it again, there is no great danger of losing that fish; for vvhen they leave it they commonly throvv it up at their first stage, that is the first time they lie still. Sometimes he will take it again after he hath left it, and run to his hold and play with it more than he did at first, shewing very good sport for a while, and and after all leave you in the lurch. A <hi>fish</hi> that takes it most greedily at the beginning, and carries it the furthest, does notwithstanding often forsake it; for as the proverb says, <hi>Nil violentum est diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnum.</hi> So a <hi>Pike</hi> that bites so eagerly at first, is too fierce to last; for it happens that he often leaves it: the only way to be even with such a <hi>Fish,</hi> is to take the Snap, and that may chance to stop his career.</p>
               <p>Now when you have a Bite, and the <hi>Fish</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:199384:42"/> goes down the Stream with it, we are apt to conceive it is a small <hi>Jack;</hi> but on the contrary, if he sails slowly upwards with the <hi>Bait,</hi> it is a sign of a good one; for the greater sort bite more calmly and moderately than the less; for they snatch, and away with it without any care or deliberation: Old <hi>Fish</hi> are more wary and cunning, they are sooner taken with a <hi>Line</hi> laid for them all night, then by <hi>Trolling.</hi> It is something difficult to know of what size a <hi>Pike</hi> is, before he is <hi>Stricken,</hi> and therefore there's none but may be mistaken in their Conjectures; for an indifferent <hi>Fish,</hi> I mean about 20 or 22 Inches, will often make as good Sport as one twice as big, however before you strike him; but then generally the bigger the <hi>Pike</hi> is, the more delightful will the Sport be. Sometimes he will take the <hi>Bait</hi> very hastily, and run out to the length of your <hi>Line,</hi> and never lie still at all, but all along he will play up and down with it, till you think fit to strike him.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Water</hi> is clear and not very deep, you may see him rise at it and take it; so you may see the <hi>Bait</hi> glister as it lies cross his mouth; you may then see when he hath <hi>Pouch'd,</hi> and know your time to strike.</p>
               <p>When you have first stricken him, you must be sure to have your <hi>Line</hi> ready and slack, that he may take as much liberty as he will; for when
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:199384:43"/> he finds himself gull'd, and trapan'd with the <hi>Hook,</hi> he will use all his might and cunning to give you the lose. As you feel him come easily towards you, you may be still drawing, till you feel him make resistance again, then you may let him have his swing, till the heat of his fury is over, then gather your <hi>Line</hi> to you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, till he starts away, and if you can get him to the top, it will the sooner tire him; for the more he strives and throws himself from you the sooner he will be weary; after this manner by drawing him up and letting him loose again, you may tire him and tame him, till you bring him to your hand, and then he will lie so quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that if the Hook was out, he could scarce strike off and get away.</p>
               <p>If you have hung him in the <hi>Gills,</hi> you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lose him, though you pull him out by meer force and violence, but if it hang loosely either in his <hi>Gorge</hi> or his <hi>Throat,</hi> he may deceive you, though he destroys himself, leaving you part of his <hi>Guts</hi> on the <hi>Hook</hi> for a <hi>Legacy,</hi> and dying soon after of his received Wounds. When you have after all this divertisement brought him to the <hi>Bank,</hi> you will find something to do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you can confidently call him your own; for if you go unadvisedly to take him out, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the <hi>Back</hi> or the <hi>Tail,</hi> or any part of his <hi>Body,</hi> though you think his best is past, and his dancing days are done, yet he may cut yo<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>This is a very quaint and delicate way of <hi>Trol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;</hi> such as use it must have their Attendants to assist them; that as the <hi>Philosopher</hi> said, <hi>Omnia mea mecum Porto.</hi> So they will have their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitors to carry their Implements and Tools after them; these are of more power on Shore, then in the Water, and have more Authority to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand their retinue by the Land, than the Fish in the Waters.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> How to preserve a River for <hi>Trolling.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe way and means to preserve a <hi>River</hi> for your own Sport, is to secure it from all those Enemies that are hurtful and destructive to it. The first and greatest, which may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Arch-Enemy,</hi> is the <hi>Drag,</hi> which is as unmerciful as an Epidemical Disease, that sweeps all into the dust; or as a greedy and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous <hi>Monopolizer,</hi> engrosseth all into its own possessions, and so verifies the old Proverb, That all are <hi>Fish</hi> that come to that Net. Some there are that commend the following of the <hi>Drag</hi> to <hi>Troll</hi> immediately after it; these love to fish in troubled Waters, for they say, The Dragging the River, stirs up the <hi>Fish</hi> and makes them more ready to catch at their prey: I cannot applaud the practice of these, nor judge it any ways consentaneous to reason; for though it be confess'd that its an hard Battel where none escapes, and that the <hi>Drag</hi> like an Universal Distemper cuts off the major part, yet still there will be some left to renew their Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which after a short time of quiet and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance will multiply and replenish the <hi>Waters.</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:199384:45"/> This I suppose, if there was none to come in and succeed them in their place, as there are continually; though (I say) they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose these ends as encouragements to their Sport, yet they will find such a scarcity and diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the <hi>Fish,</hi> that their pastime will be very cold and uncomfortable, having nothing to hope for or trust unto but those few <hi>Scape-Drags,</hi> which are only as the Gleanings when the Harvest is gone.</p>
               <p>Another Enemy to the Sport is the <hi>Bow-Net,</hi> which though it be far more favourable and sparing, and of a far lower Classis than the <hi>Drag,</hi> yet it is by so much the more dangerous by how much it is private and undiscovered; for the <hi>Drag</hi> is a profess'd and a publick Foe, which gives some notice and intimation to avoid those places it hath lately cleansed; but the <hi>Bow Net</hi> is so close and secret a Murtherer, that it cunningly slays and leaves no visible Wound.</p>
               <p>Another Plea there is that may be alledged for the <hi>Drag,</hi> which is this, that it is seldom used above once, sometimes not so often as once by the year; but the <hi>Bow-Net</hi> kills and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys, spoils and plunders all the year long; the Spring time indeed is the fittest for it, when the <hi>Fish</hi> run and get into the <hi>Scoures;</hi> or else im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after a <hi>Flood;</hi> to lay many of these in small Rivulets and Ditches, they that use them,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:199384:45"/> may then make their Harvest of them, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally after a <hi>Spring-flood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Enemy that presents it self to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of for avoiding, is the <hi>Stall</hi> or <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel:</hi> a Net which is made up of great <hi>Mashes,</hi> as it is so much the more tolerable and allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, because it holds only the great <hi>Fish,</hi> and gives the lesser leave to escape. This <hi>Net</hi> is not so common, nor so much to be condemn'd as the <hi>Bow-Net,</hi> because it is usually assisting to the <hi>Drag.</hi> In <hi>Washes</hi> and back <hi>Dikes</hi> it may do good service, because there they may both draw it, and plunge on both sides it; but in the main <hi>River</hi> it can do no great Execution, but only set as a <hi>Stall</hi> to stop the <hi>Fish:</hi> In one respect it is very Murdering, because the <hi>Mashes</hi> are made so alike on both sides, that it takes the <hi>Fish</hi> which way soever they come. They that use this Sport, have commonly two to set at a little distance, and then they may meet, and take most that are between them.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Cast-Net,</hi> it is rather a Friend and subservient to the <hi>Troll,</hi> than an Enemy to the <hi>Sport:</hi> for there is no way so good to take <hi>Baits</hi> as with that; because out of a multitude of <hi>Fish</hi> which it takes, you may have your choice of <hi>Baits.</hi> An <hi>Angle</hi> indeed may make a shift some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in <hi>Summer,</hi> but that often takes either those that are too little or too big for <hi>Baits.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:199384:46"/>
               <p>Again, a <hi>Cast-Net</hi> is helpful for the taking small <hi>Fry,</hi> to feed <hi>Pikes</hi> in a Pond or the like, so that it may be necessary and beneficial many ways. Those that use it as destructively as they can imagine, will not revenge themselves much upon the <hi>Pikes;</hi> they may kill many small <hi>Jacks</hi> with it in shallow <hi>Streams,</hi> but the great <hi>Fish</hi> that lie deep and close, are too secure from the narrow compass of a <hi>Cast-Net:</hi> It may chance to fall upon a great one sometimes, yet if there be any <hi>Weeds</hi> or <hi>Fog</hi> in the place, and the <hi>Net</hi> be not strong and well bulleted, as also the Caster very wary in drawing it up, the <hi>Pike</hi> will deceive the expectations of the <hi>Fisher.</hi> In a clear place, where there are no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or obstructions, and the bottom smooth and level, it may haply enclose and draw up a good <hi>Pike;</hi> but where there are the least en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combrances to annoy the <hi>Net,</hi> it is to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, the <hi>Fish</hi> will make his escape: The new sort of <hi>Nets</hi> that are hung with Chains instead of Bullets, are too light for this service.</p>
               <p>Next to the <hi>Nets</hi> which kill by whole sale, the <hi>Trollers</hi> are often the greatest Enemies one to another, especially the way of the <hi>Ledger-Bait,</hi> which is very destructive to the Game, for that enticing way which they use with a live <hi>Bait,</hi> and laying such an Army of <hi>Hooks,</hi> must needs weaken the Forces of the Watry Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:199384:46"/>
               <p>Dead <hi>Baits</hi> are not so pernicious, yet if they be too often used, they will much lessen the <hi>Fish;</hi> for at some seasons of the year they will bite almost till there is none left in the place: The way to favour it, is to be moderate, and not to beat a <hi>River</hi> too much or with too many <hi>Hooks;</hi> to <hi>Fish</hi> more for pleasure than for profit, and to come but once or twice in a Season to the same <hi>River.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Snare</hi> may do some harm at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the year in a Sunny day and a clear Water, that is only for by-places and narrow Scoures.</p>
               <p>One of the greatest Enemies is still to speak of, which must not be forgotten, because he is such a cunning and expert <hi>Fisher,</hi> that he generally preys upon only the greatest and the best <hi>Fish</hi> of all kinds. This is the <hi>Water-Dog,</hi> or <hi>Dog-Fisher,</hi> as some call him; which will walk five or ten Miles to a <hi>Pond</hi> in a Night, and some have disputed whether he be a Beast or a Fish: he can smell a <hi>Fish</hi> above an hundred yards from him, and then he devours them, and spoils more than he eats, leaving the Head and great part of the Back untouched. <hi>Gesner</hi> says, that his <hi>Stones</hi> are a good Remedy against the <hi>Falling Sickness;</hi> and that there is an Herb called <hi>Benione,</hi> which being hung in a Linnen Cloth near a <hi>Fish Pond</hi> or any haunt that he uses, it makes him to avoid the place. There is so many of them in a River in <hi>Cornwall,</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:199384:47"/> that <hi>Camden</hi> says the Name of it is called <hi>Otter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey,</hi> from the abundance of <hi>Otters</hi> that there breed, and are fed in it. Though this amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious Creature be chief Regent, and is Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant in the <hi>Waters,</hi> yet the greedy and audacious <hi>Pike,</hi> will sometimes set him at defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and is so bold as to give him Battel; as some have seen and observed it, that a <hi>Pike</hi> hath fought with an <hi>Otter</hi> for a <hi>Carp</hi> that he had gotten.</p>
               <p>It would not be amiss for the Conservation of the <hi>Waters,</hi> to keep the fence Months, which are three at the Spring in <hi>Spawning-time,</hi> for if the taking the <hi>Dam</hi> on her <hi>Nest</hi> when she hatches her young, were a sin so much against <hi>Nature,</hi> that it was forbidden in the Old Law, certainly the taking <hi>Fish</hi> in the time of their <hi>Spawning</hi> may be something unlawful as well as unnatural.</p>
               <p>Besides such unnatural <hi>Fishermen</hi> and all the Enemies before-mentioned, the <hi>Fish</hi> have many more, as the <hi>Bitterne,</hi> the <hi>Cormorant,</hi> the <hi>Osprey,</hi> the <hi>Sea-Gull,</hi> the <hi>Hern,</hi> the <hi>King-Fisher,</hi> and many others; which though they dare not make their prey upon the great <hi>Luce</hi> or <hi>Pike,</hi> yet they lessen the small <hi>Fry</hi> which should feed and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain the greater; and sometimes they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour young <hi>Jacks</hi> and <hi>Pickerils.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> A Description of the <hi>Rivers.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere are in the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> 555 <hi>Rivers.</hi> I cannot conceive how the number jumps so equal, or comes to be so great; but that I suppose some small <hi>Brooks</hi> and <hi>Rivulets</hi> are taken in.</p>
               <p>Now of those 555, <hi>England</hi> alone claims the greatest share, having in it 325, though there may not be so many main Streams which either have the denomination, or the fulness and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of so vast a Current. As to their Diversities, is their Situations, their Distance and Remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or their Nearness and Vicinity to the Sea; so they are different both in the qualities of their Water, as also their various kinds and species of <hi>Fishes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Those that have a more immediate intercourse with the Ocean, partake of its Influences, and have the same Vicissitudes, the same Fluxes, and Refluxes, the same Salt <hi>Water,</hi> and the same
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:199384:48"/> Scaly Army attends them which rules and bears sway under <hi>Neptunes</hi> Government: These are too deep to be fathom'd by the short Cordage of a <hi>Line,</hi> and therefore cannot be brought within the compass of our designed Treatise. Those that are more in-land and farther distant from the common Receptacle of <hi>Waters,</hi> may be brought into the Lists, and fall under the Notion of our intended Subject.</p>
               <p>To begin then with the nearest, and to set forth the praises our Native Countrey, we may prefer the Neighbouring <hi>Avon,</hi> which hath afforded opportunities for our frequent Visits, and may challenge the greatest share of our own experience.</p>
               <p>This <hi>River</hi> consists chiefly of <hi>Pike</hi> and <hi>Perch,</hi> some good <hi>Bream,</hi> few <hi>Carpe, Chevins, Gudgeon, Roches,</hi> &amp;c. and very good <hi>Eel;</hi> it is a clear, fine <hi>Stream,</hi> in most places broad, and very deep. Some call it by the Name of <hi>Nine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it hath its Original from Nine <hi>Fountains,</hi> though I cannot discover above five Rivulets that flow in to the increasing of it: <hi>Springs</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there are many, that joyn Forces to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it, the first of which arises about <hi>Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are several other <hi>Rivers</hi> that go by
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:199384:48"/> the Name of <hi>Avon,</hi> one of which takes its course through the middle of <hi>Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next in order to <hi>Avon</hi> is <hi>Welland,</hi> which may claim the second place in our <hi>Description,</hi> having much encouraged our <hi>Diversions,</hi> and contributed very freely towards the perfecting and compleating of this Art.</p>
               <p>These two, like loving Sisters, meet and salute each other at <hi>Crowland,</hi> and then part again. The <hi>Welland</hi> cannot boast of that store and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Fish</hi> as her Neighbour <hi>Avon;</hi> with <hi>Pike</hi> and smaller <hi>Perch</hi> she is abundantly furnish'd, many <hi>Bream</hi> of a middle size, store of <hi>Chubs, Dace, Gudgeons, Eels,</hi> &amp;c. She hath many turns and windings in her Current, which makes her the more Commodious for <hi>Trolling,</hi> though slow in running; so that after a great Flood, there will be no <hi>Fishing</hi> for a long time.</p>
               <p>The Third, and next to these, is the <hi>Ouse</hi> in <hi>Bedfordshire,</hi> a fair <hi>River</hi> and full of <hi>Fish,</hi> much the same as that of <hi>Avon,</hi> a good <hi>Trolling River.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From thence to the famed <hi>Cham,</hi> which gives Name to our Mother <hi>Academia;</hi> for Historiaus and Antiquaries say, That by setting a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:199384:49"/> Bridge over <hi>Cham,</hi> it was called <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>River</hi> is broad but shallow, and is not so Commodious for the <hi>Troll</hi> as the <hi>Cast-Net;</hi> here are many <hi>Gudgeons, Ruffs,</hi> small <hi>Jacks,</hi> some <hi>Trout</hi> and <hi>Chub;</hi> great part of it is <hi>Navigable;</hi> and therefore not so favourable for our <hi>Sport,</hi> not only because the sailing of the Vessels much disturbs and thickens the <hi>Waters</hi> with their Oars and Spreads, but because those continual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that keep the <hi>Water</hi> from settling, keep the <hi>Weeds</hi> from growing, which might harbour and shelter the <hi>Fish</hi> from the violence of <hi>Nets.</hi> The <hi>Stream</hi> of this <hi>Cham</hi> is somewhat Rapid and Velocious, both by reason of the shallowness of it, as also the level and streightness of it; it having but few Pits and Crooks which might render it serviceable for our <hi>Recreation.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever if its <hi>Fountains</hi> cannot send forth such <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> that will multiply and generate <hi>Fishes</hi> to furnish the Adjacent Countries, yet from that ancient Scource of Liberal <hi>Arts</hi> and Pious <hi>Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature,</hi> have flowed full <hi>Streams</hi> of Learned Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, which have refined all parts and corners of this Land.</p>
               <p>Next to this Seminary of good <hi>Education,</hi> may we place her Sister <hi>Oxonia</hi> the other Nurse and Breast of Learning: This, as well as the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:199384:49"/> other, hath the denomination from the <hi>River</hi> the Foord of <hi>Oxen;</hi> or as some derive it <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, quasi Ouseford,</hi> from the River <hi>Ouse</hi> adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it.</p>
               <p>From thence we hasten to the River <hi>Swift,</hi> whether so called from the swiftness and velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of its motion, is disputable; it waters and washeth <hi>Lutterworth</hi> in <hi>Leicester shire,</hi> and then kindly greets the greater <hi>Avon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The renowned <hi>Trent</hi> is generally known, being remarkable in the very Name and Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which some have it called from <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginta,</hi> because it is stor'd with Thirty sorts of Fishes. If that be true, she must certainly bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row some of her Mothers Brood, the Salt Off-spring of the Sea; since there are not so many distinct kinds of <hi>Fishes</hi> that have their being and habitation in the Fresh <hi>Waters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Bordering to this, is the Capacious <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and many more spreading through the <hi>Northern Climate,</hi> the most Antient of which, is the greater <hi>Ouse,</hi> Commodious for Enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the City of <hi>York.</hi> Some say, <hi>Humber</hi> is not a distinct <hi>River</hi> of its self, but only the Mouth and <hi>Aestuarium</hi> of diverse <hi>Rivers</hi> here confluent and meeting together, as <hi>Youre, Darwent,</hi> especially <hi>Ouse</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> which there changeth its Name.</p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:199384:50"/>
               <p>More Northerly still is the noted <hi>Tweed,</hi> on whose <hi>Bank</hi> is seated the Impregnable Town of <hi>Berwick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The River <hi>Tine,</hi> so famous for <hi>New-Castle,</hi> and her Inexhaustible <hi>Coal Pits. Kent</hi> boasts much of her Princely <hi>Medway,</hi> famous for harbouring the Royal Navy.</p>
               <p>Swift-running <hi>Severne</hi> is a special Glory and Ornament to the Ciry <hi>Glocester,</hi> then which (says an Ancient Author) there is not any for <hi>Channel</hi> broader, for <hi>Stream</hi> swifter, or for <hi>Fish</hi> better stored. There is in it a dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rage and fury of <hi>Waters,</hi> which may be called a <hi>Gulph</hi> or <hi>Whirl-pool</hi> of <hi>Waves,</hi> raising up the Sand from the bottom, winding and driving upon great heaps; sometimes she over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floweth her Banks, and roveth a great way up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of her Bordering grounds, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain retireth as Conqueror into her usual <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels;</hi> unhappy is the Vessel which she taketh full upon the sides; for if the <hi>VVatermen</hi> are aware of it, they turn the Vessel upon it, and cut through the middest of it, whereby they check, and avoid that violence and danger: she is called <hi>Sabrina,</hi> from the name of a Maid that was there drowned.</p>
               <p>There are many noted <hi>Rivers</hi> in <hi>Darbyshire,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:199384:50"/> Lancashire, Devonshire, Shropshire,</hi> &amp;c. the Description of which would be fit for a larger Volum, and cannot be reduced into this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitome.</p>
               <p>The most considerable of them all may be summ'd up, and comprehended in these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Verses.</p>
